    <p>Pastry Three basic rules for pastry making: 1 Keep pastry cool 2 Handle pastry lightly 3 Bake pastry ina HOT oven Cool hands, a cool pastry board or worktop, and water as cold as possible help to produce the best results. Use the fingertips, as they are the coolest part of the hands. Lift the flour well out of the bow! to incorporate as much air as possible when rubbing in the fat. Always mix with a knife. Add water gradually, a little at a time, to achieve the correct consistency for each type of pastry. Too much liquid makes heavy pastry. Avoid adding more flour after the water. In making pastry try to incorporate as much cold air as possible, so that in baking this air expands and produces light pastry. In Suet and Shortcrust this is done by rubbing in and light handling, and in ‘Ruff Puff’ and Flaky pastry the air is incorporated by folding and rolling. Roll out quickly and lightly, always rolling away from you, and not from side to side. Turn the pastry, not the rolling pin, Avoid stretching, as this causes shrinkage in baking. Roll evenly and do not roll over the ends of the pastry. Dust rolling pin and worktop lightly with flour to prevent sticking. Pies, tarts, pasties and turnovers should be brushed over with a suitable glaze before baking. Always bake in a hot oven (upper shelves) with a very hot oven for richer pastry. The three basic rules and foregoing hints apply for all the following types of pastry: 1 Short pastry (page 22) 2 ‘Ruff Puff’ pastry (page 32) 3 Suet pastry (page 36) 4 Flaky pastry (page 68) Two additional types of pastry made by completely different methods are: 5 Hot water crust pastry (page 67) 6 Choux pastry (page 72) When to use Self-Raising or Plain Flour  Short \ | ‘Ruff Puff’ + Use Be-Ro Self-Raising BY Suet crust f Flaky Hot water crust Use Be-Ro Plain Flour Choux In all recipes ‘8 oz of pastry’ means 8 oz of flour, plus ail the other ingredients.
