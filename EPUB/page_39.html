    <p>|  Cakes Delicious cakes for every occasion are readily made in a wide variety of flavours and finishes, using Be-Ro recipes based on rubbed-in, creamed, melted and whisked methods. Read the helpful notes on pages 3-5. Testing Large Cakes — Properly baked cakes should be evenly brown, shrinking slightly away from the side of the tin and firm when touched with the fingers. A fine hot skewer inserted into the centre of a non-fruited cake should come out clean. Fruit cakes — a slightly bubbling sound inside indicates that further baking is required. Sponges — should shrink slightly from the side of the tin. When pressed with a finger a sponge should spring back, leaving no impression, Cooling — Always leave cakes in their tins for 3-5 minutes to ‘set’, then turn out on to wire rack and leave to cool. Storage — Store cakes in tins or containers with well fitting lids. When storing large rich cakes for some time, wrap in greaseproof paper before placing in tins. All cakes must be properly cooled before storing. Rubbed-in Method This is a quick, easy and reliable method of cake mixing, particularly suitable for beginners and busy housewives. This type of cake will be rougher in texture than one made by the creaming method. It may rise a little more rounded, and, in some cases, may crack on the top but should never ‘peak’.
