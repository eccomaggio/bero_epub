    <p>} PLAIN FLOUR s Choux Pastry Choux Pastry (pronounced ‘shoo’) comes from France and several recipes, such as Eclairs, still retain their French names.  This pastry is easy to make and produces light attractive shapes, of crisp texture, suitable for both sweet and savoury finishes. Plain Flour is used, since the eggs and air introduced at the beating stage provide the raising power. The wet baking sheet produces steam to help the raising action.
