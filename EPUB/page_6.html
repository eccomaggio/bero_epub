    <h1>A word on ingredients</h1>
    <p><b>Sugar</b> &mdash; caster sugar dissolves easily and is most suitable for cake making; being finer it is more
      easily creamed than granulated sugar, which is better used for rubbed-in cakes and scones. Demarara and other
      brown sugars are often used in rich fruit cakes and gingerbreads to improve the flavour and colour. Icing sugar
      should be sieved if at all lumpy. </p>
    <p><b>Eggs</b> are better used at room temperature, rather than cold from the refrigerator, but this is not
      essential. Eggs add richness to the recipe. Break eggs separately into a cup to ensure freshness. Standard eggs
      are used in all Be-Ro recipes, unless otherwise stated. </p>
    <p><b>Liquids</b> &mdash; milk adds richness to a mixture and gives a closer, heavier texture. Water gives a
      lighter, short texture. Very cold water is necessary for certain pastries. </p>
    <p><b>Fats</b> &mdash; use the type stated in the recipe. Butter is used for its flavour and keeping qualities but
      margarine is better for giving volume in creamed cakes, Use pure lard in pastry-making. Proprietary vegetable
      shortenings are useful, but more expensive. Oil is best for frying. Use lard for greasing tins. </p>
    <p><b>Fruit</b> &mdash; buy clean fruit, or wash and dry it before use. Damp fruit will sink to the bottom of a
      cake. Very syrupy cherries should be halved, then washed or wiped and dusted with flour. Add fruit after the
      flour, for fruit coated with sugary fat is likely to sink.</p>
