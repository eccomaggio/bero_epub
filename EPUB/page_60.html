    <p>    Plain Flour Recipes Yeast Cookery: Bread, Rolls and Buns Our Daily Bread... Surely there is nothing to equal the appetising smell of hot, freshly baked home-made bread. Children are missing one of the great delights of home baking if Mother does not occasionally try her hand and experience the satisfaction of baking crusty bread for the family. And bread making is not at all difficult!  N i ‘ CUTs our OVEN DOUBT °  Plain flour is always used for white bread. BE-RO PLAIN FLOUR, milled from blended hard and soft wheats, is amply strong enough for yeast cookery. Flour strength depends on the gluten (protein) content. This elastic substance helps the dough to rise and gives the loaf its shape during the baking. It always pays to use the best flour. Yeast feeds on the flour and sugar in conditions of warmth and moisture to produce carbon dioxide gas, which acts as the raising agent to stretch and expand the dough, helped by the gluten in the flour. Yeast multiplies and works best ata temperature of 80-85 F. Too much heat kills the yeast cells, and cold or draughts retard the action. The hot oven causes the gas to expand and raise the dough during the first few minutes of baking, as well as killing off the yeast cells when their work is done. Nowadays fresh yeast is not widely available and has been largely replaced by dried yeast for domestic use. BE-RO DRIED YEAST is ordinary active yeast, specially dried or dehydrated, it = in the form of small pellets which can be ioratronvowenaema~=—=——~Ss« Stored in cool dry conditions for long = -_- periods. Dried yeast remains alive, and can be used with complete success in all yeast recipes. Be-Ro Dried Yeast is conveniently packed in moisture-proof sachets, each containing just the right amount required for 3 Ib flour, when making bread. Keep some sachets handy and you are always ready for yeast cookery! AIEEE ——_——___ } ; : PP  To reconstitute Dried Yeast: 1 Dissolve one teaspoon caster sugar in up to pint warm water (1 part boiling to 2 parts cold). The water should not be too hot — blood heat or 100 F is correct. 2 Add dried yeast, stir and leave until a good froth appears on top (10-15 minutes). Page 59 SS</p>
