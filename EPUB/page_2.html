    <p>For many years Be-Ro Self-Raising Flour has enjoyed an unrivalled reputation among home cooks everywhere as the
      supreme flour for all baking, giving a consistently high standard of results for scones, cakes, pastry and
      puddings alike. Some 30 million copies of the Be-Ro Home Recipes Book have been distributed over the years, and in
      many families four generations have grown up learning to rely on, and bake with, Be-Ro Self-Raising Flour. </p>
    <p>In recent years Be-Ro Wheatmeal and Plain Flour have become widely accepted by discerning housewives. In response
      to many requests for additional recipes this enlarged 31st Edition has been completely rewritten, and incorporates
      new recipes for Wheatmeal, Plain Flour and other Be-Ro products, whilst the traditional Self-Raising Flour recipes
      have been revised where necessary. </p>
    <p>Frequent regular deliveries from our nation-wide network of Depots ensures that stocks in the shops are
      maintained in fresh and perfect condition. To give all your baking the results you deserve, be sure to ask for
      Be-Ro flour.</p>
