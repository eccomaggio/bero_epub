    <p>  Rich Cakes Rich cakes contain at least half fat-to-flour weight. The amount of fruit or flavouring does not determine the type of cake. | A ‘plain cake’ may contain a high proportion of fruit whilst Madeira, a ‘rich cake’, contains none. Rich cakes keep well. When quite cool, store in an airtight tin.   | | | Creaming Method This is generally used for rich cakes 1 Place fat and sugar in warm bowl. Do not allow to ‘oil’ 2 Cream together with wooden spoon or electric mixer until the colour changes from yellow to white. The mixture will then be soft and fluffy, with no ‘grittiness’ or 3 Break the eggs, one at a time, into the mixture and add from the recipe one level tablespoon of flour — beat thoroughly. This prevents the mixture separating or curdling. Continue urtil all the eggs are added, add any spice or flavouring at this stage, but not fruit 4 Use metal tablespoon to ‘fold in’ flour, a little at a time, to the mixture — alternately with any liquid in the recipe. This means stir once round bowl and once through the middle. Continue with this action until all flour is mixed in. At this stage do not beat or stir as this may spoil the cake 5 Add any fruit and fold in lightly 6 Place the cake mixture into suitable tin and hollow slightly in the centre 7 In general, bake in a moderate oven on a middle or lower shelf   Victoria Sandwich Basic Recipe  4 oz Margarine 4 oz Caster Sugar a bac 4 oz Be-Ro S.R.
