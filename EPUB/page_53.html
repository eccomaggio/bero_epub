    <p>  Sponges Whisking Method A true sponge contains no fat. The eggs and sugar are whisked together until thick and creamy, leaving a trail when the whisk is removed. An electric mixer facilitates whisking, but with hand whisking, placing the bowl over hot water helps to give a faster result. Then gently fold in flour with a metal spoon or spatula, never a wooden spoon. Bake sponges on middle shelf and avoid opening oven door during baking time.
