    <p>Proportion of yeast to flour for making bread, buns, etc.   Be-Ro Plain or Be-Ro Dried Yeast Fresh Yeast Wheatmeal Flour ra Fullsachet=ie.40z —_§ 19-3 Ib or3teaspoons oz upto tb Half sachet — i.e. 4 oz Loz or 14 teaspoons   Sugar A teaspoon of sugar is needed to reconstitute the yeast. For sweet buns, doughs, etc., the remainder of the sugar is mixed with the flour, and not added directly to the yeast. Salt gives flavour to bread, but too much affects the yeast, so the salt should always be mixed with the flour and not added directly to the yeast. Fat enriches a bread dough and improves the keeping qualities of the bread. Fat is also added to soft bun doughs. Kneading the dough Use the hands to knead the mixed dough on a floured board or worktop. Knead thoroughly, stretching and pulling the dough with the fingers and heel of hand to introduce air, disperse the yeast mixture and elasticate the gluten in the flour. If the dough is a little too moist, it will adjust itself during kneading, until it is of the right consistency. Too little liquid prevents the gluten from softening, and the finished loaf will have too close a texture, Raising the dough Place the dough in a warm greased bowl, cover with a greased polythene bag or sheet, or with a damp tea towel. Stand in a warm place (80 F) e.g. the rack over a cooker, in front of a fire, etc. Keep free from draughts, but avoid excessive heat. The dough should be allowed to double in size, when it will be softer with a honeycomb effect, caused by countless pockets of gas. Proving the dough takes place when the shaped dough (in tins or on baking sheet) is covered with a clean cloth and put into a warm place until risen to the top of tins, or toa well-rounded shape. This takes 15-45 minutes depending on size. Do not over-prove or the shape will be spoiled. Bake immediately in a hot oven. Glaze, if desired, with beaten egg or milk. Fora crusty finish, glaze top with Salt Solution (2 teaspoons salt dissolved in 2 tablespoons water) To test if baked —- tap underside of loaf or rolls with knuckles; when cooked they will sound hollow. If not properly baked, put bread back in oven, without tins, for a further 5 minutes Bread Rolls (page 61)  Page 60 a </p>
