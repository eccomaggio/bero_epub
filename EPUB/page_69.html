    <p>Flaky Pastry Flaky Pastry calls for a little more care and trouble in making than ‘Ruff Puff’, but for special pies and pastries, the beautifully light, crisp crust is well worth the time spent. Cool working conditions and skill with the rolling pin are both important. The object is to incorporate thin layers of fat between thin layers of dough and so encase as much air as possible. When placed in a hot oven, this air expands and lifts each thin layer of pastry up separately, so plain flour is used, The dough is more ‘sticky’ than ‘Ruff Puff’ and more flour is needed for rolling out. Brush off surplus flour before folding to maintain the recipe balance. Before rolling, lightly seal edges of folded dough with rolling pin so that the fat does not burst through. To glaze, brush over the surface of the pastry, not the sides, as this will prevent rising. Always bake in a very hot oven,   8 oz Be-Ro Plain Flour Fiaky Pastry Pinch Salt o R e 6 oz Fat (equa! Margarine 8 OZ Basic ecipe and Lard) Cold Water (about + pint) 7 xs teaspoon Lemon Juice (optional) | 1 Mix flour and salt in bowl 2 Blend fats together and divide into four portions f &lt; 3 Rub one portion of fat into flour, add lemon juice and enough cold water to form an elastic dough, using a knife 4 Turn out on to well floured board, and roll out into a rectangular strip. Brush off surplus flour 5 Cover two-thirds of pastry P rectangle with another portion of fat, dotting over the surface in knobs 6 Fold the pastry into three by bringing the end without fat to the centre, then folding , . down the other third 7 Press together pastry edges with fingers or rolling pin, | | ; —aas   give pastry half a turn, so that folds are to left and right, and roll out lightly 8 Repeat the process twice more to use up the remaining two portions of fat, rolling out afterwards 9 Fold pastry and leaveina cold place for an hour before rolling out to required shape for use  Page 68 </p>
